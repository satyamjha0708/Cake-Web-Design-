                            Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350Â°F (177Â°C).

                            <p>Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium
                            bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
                            food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a
                            9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring
                            cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot
                            pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step
                            4 Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.

                            <p>Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream
                            cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is
                            smooth and creamy, about minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat
                            until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until
                            just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the
                            cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.

                            Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your
                            roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.
                            As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake
                            batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the
                            pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the
                            oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is
                            easier for you).

                            Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost. set. When it's done, the center
                            of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the
                            oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1
                            hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then
                            refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p></div>
